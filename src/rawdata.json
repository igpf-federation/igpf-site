This means that there is primary care available from 8 – 8, seven days a week.\n\nThe extra appointments are provided from the Lister Primary Care Centre in Peckham. On any given day, these appointments help a GP practice to manage their capacity and provide care for their patients even if their own appointments are fully booked.\n\nThe service is available to South Southwark patients who:\n- require urgent same or next day urgent care in general practice and have been telephone assessed by a GP or trained senior nurse in their own practice\n- can be managed by a GP or primary care nurse in the community (and do not need to go to hospital)\n\n## Can I ask for an EPCS appointment?\n\nIf you are unable to get an immediate appointment at your GP practice, an EPCS appointment should be offered to you. If this is not offered please ask the receptionist.\n\n## How will the doctor at the EPCS know about my health history?\n\nDoctors and nurses at the EPCS can access a patient’s full medical records (with the patient’s consent) to be able to offer the right care and treatment.\n\n## What happens if a patient’s health condition needs more detailed attention?\n\nWhen making an assessment, a doctor or nurse at the EPCS may decide that a patient may be better seen in their own practice. This is more likely when the patient has complex needs.\n\nPatients who may need further routine investigation or another referral may be asked to contact their own practice to make these arrangements.\n\nThe EPCS has been funded by NHS Southwark Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). IHL was awarded the EPCS contract for South Southwark in 2015.\n\n[Find out more about who runs the

Primary Care Service","content":"## What is the Extended Primary Care Service (EPCS)?\n\nThe Extended Primary Care Service (EPCS) provides patients in South Southwark with additional GP and nurse appointments. This means that there is primary care available from 8 – 8, seven days a week.\n\nThe extra appointments are provided from the Lister Primary Care Centre in Peckham. On any given day, these appointments help a GP practice to manage their capacity and provide care for their patients even if their own appointments are fully booked.\n\nThe service is available to South Southwark patients who:\n- require urgent same or next day urgent care in general practice and have been telephone assessed by a GP or trained senior nurse in their own practice\n- can be managed by a GP or primary care nurse in the community (and do not need to go to hospital)\n\n## Can I ask for an EPCS appointment?\n\nIf you are unable to get an immediate appointment at your GP practice, an EPCS appointment should be offered to you. If this is not offered please ask the receptionist.\n\n## How will the doctor at the EPCS know about my health history?\n\nDoctors and nurses at the EPCS can access a patient’s full medical records (with the patient’s consent) to be able to offer the right care and treatment.\n\n## What happens if a patient’s health condition needs more detailed attention?\n\nWhen making an assessment, a doctor or nurse at the EPCS may decide that a patient may be better seen in their own practice. This is more likely when the patient has complex needs.\n\nPatients who may need further routine investigation or another referral may be asked to contact their own practice to make these arrangements.\n\nThe EPCS has been funded by NHS Southwark Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). IHL was awarded the EPCS contract for South Southwark in 2015.\n\n[Find out more about who runs the

One of our early successes is our Extended Primary Care Service, which offers additional GP and nurse appointments from 8-8, seven days a week at the Lister Health Centre.","image":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"A7nScjwYDIua8CY2uCGOi"}},"subsections":[{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"4jJP5eQ0Eoaq6KsakSCass"}},{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Entry","id":"4vGxaISG0Uuy8qQc8USSiw"}}]}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"2UBGRtv5XGWKakMm0QimyK","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-22T17:15:57.738Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:15:57.738Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"person"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Tony Stark","role":"Financeer & Boss Man","email":"tstark@email.com","picture":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"2bYOHCSd0AiyWuG4aUiogA","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-08-22T17:15:48.730Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:15:48.730Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"5241977-3756113661-50848","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/j8ta1zjgpdh9/2bYOHCSd0AiyWuG4aUiogA/eb6f068e09f8d96fee66f98468f64064/5067362-7997958825-48054.jpg","details":{"size":327363,"image":{"width":960,"height":1280}},"fileName":"5067362-7997958825-48054.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"2mvZ3FYE8IkkqSooWUUeUG","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-22T17:00:07.804Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:00:07.804Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"section"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Vision","content":"## Our vision\nLocal people are able to access excellent, proactive and coordinated care consistently and equitably, delivered in a model of primary care that is financially viable and which offers sustainable and fulfilling careers to the whole primary care team.\n\n## Our mission\nTo work with member practices so that they are better able to work together (and with other partners) to maximise their financial sustainability, to support practical workforce development and to enable more consistent and equitable delivery of high quality care.\n\n## Our values\n- professional: open and trustworthy, reliable, efficient\n- accountable\n- dedicated and committed\n- making a difference","image":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1RrYdV6IUEieiSm6Wua2aC"}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"4jJP5eQ0Eoaq6KsakSCass","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-18T15:21:58.289Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:13:07.022Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"subsection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Extended Primary Care Service","content":"## What is the Extended Primary Care Service (EPCS)?\n\nThe Extended Primary Care Service (EPCS) provides patients in South Southwark with additional GP and nurse appointments. This means that there is primary care available from 8 – 8, seven days a week.\n\nThe extra appointments are provided from the Lister Primary Care Centre in Peckham. On any given day, these appointments help a GP practice to manage their capacity and provide care for their patients even if their own appointments are fully booked.\n\nThe service is available to South Southwark patients who:\n- require urgent same or next day urgent care in general practice and have been telephone assessed by a GP or trained senior nurse in their own practice\n- can be managed by a GP or primary care nurse in the community (and do not need to go to hospital)\n\n## Can I ask for an EPCS appointment?\n\nIf you are unable to get an immediate appointment at your GP practice, an EPCS appointment should be offered to you. If this is not offered please ask the receptionist.\n\n## How will the doctor at the EPCS know about my health history?\n\nDoctors and nurses at the EPCS can access a patient’s full medical records (with the patient’s consent) to be able to offer the right care and treatment.\n\n## What happens if a patient’s health condition needs more detailed attention?\n\nWhen making an assessment, a doctor or nurse at the EPCS may decide that a patient may be better seen in their own practice. This is more likely when the patient has complex needs.\n\nPatients who may need further routine investigation or another referral may be asked to contact their own practice to make these arrangements.\n\nThe EPCS has been funded by NHS Southwark Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). IHL was awarded the EPCS contract for South Southwark in 2015.\n\n[Find out more about who runs the EPCS.](http://www.ihlsouthwark.co.uk/epcs/epcs-team/)","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"27zqCQP8KEAwy4qMWe4wcm","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-08-22T17:02:08.925Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:02:08.925Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"disappearing-primary-care-doctor","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/j8ta1zjgpdh9/27zqCQP8KEAwy4qMWe4wcm/776c8b7306fb195f996e5212bfbe6049/disappearing-primary-care-doctor.jpg","details":{"size":159246,"image":{"width":500,"height":333}},"fileName":"disappearing-primary-care-doctor.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}}]}}
