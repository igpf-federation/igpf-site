This means that there is primary care available from 8 – 8, seven days a week.\n\nThe extra appointments are provided from the Lister Primary Care Centre in Peckham. On any given day, these appointments help a GP practice to manage their capacity and provide care for their patients even if their own appointments are fully booked.\n\nThe service is available to South Southwark patients who:\n- require urgent same or next day urgent care in general practice and have been telephone assessed by a GP or trained senior nurse in their own practice\n- can be managed by a GP or primary care nurse in the community (and do not need to go to hospital)\n\n## Can I ask for an EPCS appointment?\n\nIf you are unable to get an immediate appointment at your GP practice, an EPCS appointment should be offered to you. If this is not offered please ask the receptionist.\n\n## How will the doctor at the EPCS know about my health history?\n\nDoctors and nurses at the EPCS can access a patient’s full medical records (with the patient’s consent) to be able to offer the right care and treatment.\n\n## What happens if a patient’s health condition needs more detailed attention?\n\nWhen making an assessment, a doctor or nurse at the EPCS may decide that a patient may be better seen in their own practice. This is more likely when the patient has complex needs.\n\nPatients who may need further routine investigation or another referral may be asked to contact their own practice to make these arrangements.\n\nThe EPCS has been funded by NHS Southwark Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). IHL was awarded the EPCS contract for South Southwark in 2015.\n\n[Find out more about who runs the EPCS.](http://www.ihlsouthwark.co.uk/epcs/epcs-team/)","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"27zqCQP8KEAwy4qMWe4wcm","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-08-22T17:02:08.925Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:02:08.925Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"disappearing-primary-care-doctor","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/j8ta1zjgpdh9/27zqCQP8KEAwy4qMWe4wcm/776c8b7306fb195f996e5212bfbe6049/disappearing-primary-care-doctor.jpg","details":{"size":159246,"image":{"width":500,"height":333}},"fileName":"disappearing-primary-care-doctor.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"4vGxaISG0Uuy8qQc8USSiw","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-22T16:56:03.009Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T16:58:17.950Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"subsection"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Strategic objectives","content":"- Establish a robust and effective federation with strong leadership\n- Ensure that our member practices are engaged in the work we are doing and agree upon the need to come together to develop new ways of working and delivering care\n- Deliver a high quality and safe Extended Primary Care Service (EPCS) that supports practices through providing additional capacity and makes it easier for patients to access an appointment\n- Deliver high quality Population Health Management (PHM) services through both practices and hubs to ensure all practices can offer their patients the same care\n- Support our member practices to be more effective and resilient organisations","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"1wk5d1tyYouqMACqksAoUe","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-08-22T16:55:55.726Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T16:55:55.726Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Objecitves-400x300","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/j8ta1zjgpdh9/1wk5d1tyYouqMACqksAoUe/d26faebd1a8a7da5df880184dc39f52b/Objecitves-400x300.jpg","details":{"size":13354,"image":{"width":400,"height":300}},"fileName":"Objecitves-400x300.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}}],"services":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"4rcHWKmys8gu0eEccco4yK","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-01T15:16:37.370Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-01T15:16:37.370Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"service"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"ENT","shortDescription":"Islington Community Ear Nose and Throat Clinic is a popular and successful service running from its two sites at City Road Medical Centre and Hornsey Rise.

This means that there is primary care available from 8 – 8, seven days a week.\n\nThe extra appointments are provided from the Lister Primary Care Centre in Peckham. On any given day, these appointments help a GP practice to manage their capacity and provide care for their patients even if their own appointments are fully booked.\n\nThe service is available to South Southwark patients who:\n- require urgent same or next day urgent care in general practice and have been telephone assessed by a GP or trained senior nurse in their own practice\n- can be managed by a GP or primary care nurse in the community (and do not need to go to hospital)\n\n## Can I ask for an EPCS appointment?\n\nIf you are unable to get an immediate appointment at your GP practice, an EPCS appointment should be offered to you. If this is not offered please ask the receptionist.\n\n## How will the doctor at the EPCS know about my health history?\n\nDoctors and nurses at the EPCS can access a patient’s full medical records (with the patient’s consent) to be able to offer the right care and treatment.\n\n## What happens if a patient’s health condition needs more detailed attention?\n\nWhen making an assessment, a doctor or nurse at the EPCS may decide that a patient may be better seen in their own practice. This is more likely when the patient has complex needs.\n\nPatients who may need further routine investigation or another referral may be asked to contact their own practice to make these arrangements.\n\nThe EPCS has been funded by NHS Southwark Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). IHL was awarded the EPCS contract for South Southwark in 2015.\n\n[Find out more about who runs the EPCS.](http://www.ihlsouthwark.co.uk/epcs/epcs-team/)","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"27zqCQP8KEAwy4qMWe4wcm","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-08-22T17:02:08.925Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:02:08.925Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"disappearing-primary-care-doctor","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/j8ta1zjgpdh9/27zqCQP8KEAwy4qMWe4wcm/776c8b7306fb195f996e5212bfbe6049/disappearing-primary-care-doctor.jpg","details":{"size":159246,"image":{"width":500,"height":333}},"fileName":"disappearing-primary-care-doctor.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"2mvZ3FYE8IkkqSooWUUeUG","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-22T17:00:07.804Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:00:07.804Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"section"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Vision","content":"## Our vision\nLocal people are able to access excellent, proactive and coordinated care consistently and equitably, delivered in a model of primary care that is financially viable and which offers sustainable and fulfilling careers to the whole primary care team.\n\n## Our mission\nTo work with member practices so that they are better able to work together (and with other partners) to maximise their financial sustainability, to support practical workforce development and to enable more consistent and equitable delivery of high quality care.\n\n## Our values\n- professional: open and trustworthy, reliable, efficient\n- accountable\n- dedicated and committed\n- making a difference","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"1RrYdV6IUEieiSm6Wua2aC","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-08-22T17:00:01.733Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:00:01.733Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Vision Forest","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/j8ta1zjgpdh9/1RrYdV6IUEieiSm6Wua2aC/6b5c8eb076ecf936f0194c09e86054b9/Vision_Forest.jpg","details":{"size":337349,"image":{"width":1347,"height":898}},"fileName":"Vision_Forest.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"52YO0yY08MYK8IwAsa2iwy","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-01T15:19:37.942Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-01T15:19:37.942Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"person"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Dr Craig Seymour","role":"Central Locality GP Director","biography":"Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod.

This means that there is primary care available from 8 – 8, seven days a week.\n\nThe extra appointments are provided from the Lister Primary Care Centre in Peckham. On any given day, these appointments help a GP practice to manage their capacity and provide care for their patients even if their own appointments are fully booked.\n\nThe service is available to South Southwark patients who:\n- require urgent same or next day urgent care in general practice and have been telephone assessed by a GP or trained senior nurse in their own practice\n- can be managed by a GP or primary care nurse in the community (and do not need to go to hospital)\n\n## Can I ask for an EPCS appointment?\n\nIf you are unable to get an immediate appointment at your GP practice, an EPCS appointment should be offered to you. If this is not offered please ask the receptionist.\n\n## How will the doctor at the EPCS know about my health history?\n\nDoctors and nurses at the EPCS can access a patient’s full medical records (with the patient’s consent) to be able to offer the right care and treatment.\n\n## What happens if a patient’s health condition needs more detailed attention?\n\nWhen making an assessment, a doctor or nurse at the EPCS may decide that a patient may be better seen in their own practice. This is more likely when the patient has complex needs.\n\nPatients who may need further routine investigation or another referral may be asked to contact their own practice to make these arrangements.\n\nThe EPCS has been funded by NHS Southwark Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). IHL was awarded the EPCS contract for South Southwark in 2015.\n\n[Find out more about who runs the EPCS.](http://www.ihlsouthwark.co.uk/epcs/epcs-team/)","image":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"27zqCQP8KEAwy4qMWe4wcm","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-08-22T17:02:08.925Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:02:08.925Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"disappearing-primary-care-doctor","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/j8ta1zjgpdh9/27zqCQP8KEAwy4qMWe4wcm/776c8b7306fb195f996e5212bfbe6049/disappearing-primary-care-doctor.jpg","details":{"size":159246,"image":{"width":500,"height":333}},"fileName":"disappearing-primary-care-doctor.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"2mvZ3FYE8IkkqSooWUUeUG","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-08-22T17:00:07.804Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-22T17:00:07.804Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"section"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Vision","content":"## Our vision\nLocal people are able to access excellent, proactive and coordinated care consistently and equitably, delivered in a model of primary care that is financially viable and which offers sustainable and fulfilling careers to the whole primary care team.\n\n## Our mission\nTo work with member practices so that they are better able to work together (and with other partners) to maximise their financial sustainability, to support practical workforce development and to enable more consistent and equitable delivery of high quality care.\n\n## Our values\n- professional: open and trustworthy, reliable, efficient\n- accountable\n- dedicated and committed\n- making a difference","image":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1RrYdV6IUEieiSm6Wua2aC"}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"j8ta1zjgpdh9"}},"id":"52YO0yY08MYK8IwAsa2iwy","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-01T15:19:37.942Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-01T15:19:37.942Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"person"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Dr Craig Seymour","role":"Central Locality GP Director","biography":"Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod.
